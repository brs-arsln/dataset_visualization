Overview

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook script for visualizing data. The script includes various data visualization techniques to help understand and interpret the dataset effectively.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages:
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - numpy

Setup Instructions

1. Download the Script and Dataset:

   Download the `DataVisualization.ipynb` script and the dataset file to your local machine.

2. Install Python and Jupyter Notebook:

   If you haven't already, download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). After installing Python, install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:
   ```sh
   pip install notebook
   ```

3. Install Required Python Packages:

   Open your terminal or command prompt and install the required Python packages by running:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
   ```

4. Open Jupyter Notebook:

   Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the script and dataset, and start Jupyter Notebook by running:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open and Run the Script:

   In the Jupyter Notebook interface, open the `DataVisualization.ipynb` file. Run each cell in the notebook to execute the script and visualize the data.

Usage

The script is designed to read a dataset, process it, and generate various visualizations. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load your dataset and execute the visualizations. The visualizations will help you understand the data distributions, relationships, and trends.
